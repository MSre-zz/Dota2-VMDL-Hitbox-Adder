# Dota2-VMDL-Hitbox-Adder
If you aren't interested in the source, you only need the top level .jar file and the resource folder with the two text files. The eclipse project folder can be deleted.

Automatically adds Cube.dmx to boneless models while preserving the model's meshes. Just copy/pasting the pastebin would override the meshes, and I have a lot of boneless models that need hitboxes.

Drag and drop files into the white box in the program. I set it up to ignore everything that isn't a .vmdl so that I could just box everything and have it work.

Use this program at your own risk, I am not liable for anything... 

Added the source code. Feel free to heavily criticize it. I do most of my programming in cobol so I'm not very good with ... modern ... languages. Using this and other utilities I make for Dota 2 modding as a learning experience.
